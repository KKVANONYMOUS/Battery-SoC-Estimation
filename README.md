# Battery-SoC-Estimation

This is the Battery SoC Estimation code for EE-401 Lab

A simple and naive battery modelisation + Kalman filter for state of charge (SoC) estimation

## Python implementation

python3 implementation of an extended Kalman filter for state of charge (SoC) estimation of a simulated lithium battery. The model used for the battery is a simple Thevenin model.

To run it just launch:

```sh
$> python Python/main.py
```

Or use any python IDE (spyder/ jupyter notebook) and run the main.py file.

## Files:

- **battery.py:** It implements the battery model as a python class with properties and methods to update and set/get the battery properties. It can be run to produce the OCV vs SOC plot.
- **extended_kalman_filter.py:** It implements the extended Kalman filter with the methods predict and update.
- **utils.py:** It has a polynomial class that outputs f(x) where f(x) is a polynomial function and x is an input. It can also give the derivative of that function
- **main.py:** It runs the program and contains the flow of the code. Contains all the function calls and object creation of all the classes to instantiate their object with initial values.
- **protocol.py:** It is the flow of the experiment which simulates the battery soc result.

## Dependencies:

    - python3
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
